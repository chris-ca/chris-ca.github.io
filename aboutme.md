My name is Christian Weyland and I'm an outdoor, cycling and web enthusiast born and raised in Germany. I've lived and worked in Germany, Canada and Switzerland.

As of April 2023 I'm open to job opportunities in Western Europe.

## Professional background
I'm originally a full-stack (LAMP) web developer with a strong liking for devops and a business mindset. After my agency career I've worked in various roles in the travel industry:

- As **online marketing specialist** for the German source market
- As a **key account manager** and technical contact for a multinational team 
- As a **product owner** (SCRUM/PSPO) for website + APIs

## Travel
The travel bug got hold of me. I couldn't help it. From 6/2018 to 3/2023 embarked on a self-funded, extensive bicycle trip covering more than 40 countries on 3 continents. My travel website [bumyproad.org](https://bumpyroad.org) has some stories, including my route and lots of photos. Though I got very lazy posting the last years, I hope I'll catch up some day.

## Coding
While coding was never a requirement for my latest positions it was extremely helpful to increase productivity for both, my own tasks as well as for colleagues.

While the code I've created at work remains closed source, my [Github repository](https://github.com/chris-ca/) has a few bits on hobby projects I've done.

#### My stack:
- For the server: Any Debian based `Linux` distro
- For the desktop: `Ubuntu`
- For fun: Raspbian, of course
- Text editing: `tmux` and `vim`
- Web development: `PHP` with `Yii`, `Craft CMS`. Will touch `Javascript` or `SQL` if necessary.
- For data processing and shell: `Python`
- Learnt in school and long forgotten: Pascal / Modula 2

## Hobbies and interests
- Cycling/bicycle touring
- Trekking, hiking, camping
- Sports climbing (indoors and outdoors)
- Mapping and contributing to [Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/chris-ca)
- Video editing with kdenlive
- Anything else involving a computer
